# Voice audit - phrases to retire (execution checklist)

Scan complete when `rg` on `docs/` returns **zero** matches for the patterns below.

## Global replacements

| Retire | Replace with |
|--------|----------------|
| "Internet IP" as hero noun (user-facing) | **trend** or "idea / meme / brand" |
| "IP page" in user guides | **trend page** |
| "Create an IP" | **Create a trend** |
| "IPs & tokens" | **Trends and tokens** |
| "scaffold" / "Coming soon" / "content coming soon" | Real content or explicit "not public" one sentence |
| `<Note>` blocks that only say add a screenshot | Real `![](/images/...)` + descriptive alt text |
| "typically" / "commonly" / "often" / "may" / "might" / "roughly" | Commit to the number. If the number can change, commit AND add a one-line `<Note>` that the protocol sets it. |
| "confirm in the UI" / "follow the live app" / "subject to limits shown" | State the fact. The live UI is always the ultimate truth; documentation should not dodge the statement. |
| "some builds" / "your build" / "legacy builds" | There is one build. State what the product does now. |
